# Natural Language Processing-Project

In this project, we are using the spaCy library, which is an open-source Python library used for natural language processing (NLP). The aim is to analyze the text from student answered prompts, which may contain a large amount of unstructured data. We use spaCy to parse and analyze the text, identifying the important information and extracting it for further processing.

Once the text has been analyzed, we clean the extracted information to ensure that it is free from any noise or unnecessary details. We then use a summarization algorithm to generate a condensed version of the text, which captures the essential information.

Additionally, we are also interested in focusing on information that may not be in the majority, but is still relevant to the overall analysis. This helps to ensure that we are not overlooking any significant details or biases in the data. By leveraging the capabilities of spaCy and our own custom summarization algorithm, we aim to generate insights from the student-written prompts that may not have been easily accessible through manual analysis.
